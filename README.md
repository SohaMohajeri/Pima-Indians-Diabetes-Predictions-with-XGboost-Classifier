Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes. 

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. So, here we will perform exploratory data analysis and build two machine learning models with K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and XGboost Classifier to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
